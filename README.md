# stepperphotogopi
Control a stepper motor and a photo machine to make 360 photos to an object, using a raspberry pi programmed in go, all with a web interface
## Scope of this project
This is a little project I am creating for rotating an object 360 degree and make photos of it every x degrees. Then, it should present the user these photos so that they can be used in an online shop. My raspberry actually is in a private network so right by now no authentication will be done
